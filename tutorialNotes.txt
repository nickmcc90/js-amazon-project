The main idea of javascript is to...
1. Save the data
2. Generate the HTML
3. Make it interactive

Since we want to find the HTML we want to copy, then paste it a bunch..
we inspect element on the page and find out what the HTML element is called,
or what its class name is. Then we do Ctrl+F in the code to find it.

Now we cooooooould just copy and paste the code we find a bunch of times. But
this is inefficient.
